✨ **My Simple React To-Do List App** ✨

📝 **Overview**

This project is a clean and intuitive To-Do List application built with React. It offers a straightforward way for users to manage their daily tasks by allowing them to easily add, mark as complete, and delete items.
I developed this application as a hands-on exercise to solidify my understanding of fundamental React concepts and to showcase core frontend development skills.

🚀 **Features**

Add New Tasks: Quickly add new to-do items to your list.
Mark as Complete: Effortlessly toggle tasks between pending and completed states.
Delete Tasks: Permanently remove tasks you no longer need.
Persistence: All your tasks are automatically saved in the browser's local storage, ensuring your list remains intact even after closing or refreshing the browser.
Absolutely! Based on your existing repository at https://github.com/Sarahpiri/TodoList-App-English-version, here's a professional and clean README crafted specifically for you as a junior frontend developer. This version aims to be highly presentable, visually appealing, and informative, while highlighting the valuable skills you've gained.

💡 **What I Learned**

This project provided invaluable hands-on experience and helped me deepen my understanding of several core frontend development concepts:
Component-Based Architecture: Gained practical experience in breaking down complex UIs into reusable and modular React components.
Effective State Management: Learned how to efficiently manage and update component state to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
Prop Drilling & Data Flow: Understood the importance and implementation of passing data between parent and child components using props.
Client-Side Data Persistence: Successfully implemented the Local Storage API to save user data directly in the browser, ensuring task lists persist across sessions.
React App Deployment: Gained experience in the process of deploying a React application to a hosting service like GitHub Pages.
